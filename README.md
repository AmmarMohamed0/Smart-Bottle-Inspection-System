# Smart-Bottle-Inspection-System
This project uses YOLO for object detection and tracking, along with OpenAI API for automated quality inspection of bottle labels. It processes video frames, detects bottles, crops detected regions, and analyzes them to check for label presence and damage. The results are saved in a structured format for quality control.
